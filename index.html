        <h2>What is Automata theory</h2>
        <p>Automata theory is the study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them. It is a theory in theoretical computer science. The word automata (the plural of automaton) comes from the Greek word αὐτόματα, which means "self-making".</p>
        <P>Automata theory is closely related to formal language theory. An automaton is a finite representation of a formal language that may be an infinite set. Automata are often classified by the class of formal languages they can recognize, typically illustrated by the Chomsky hierarchy, which describes the relations between various languages and kinds of formalized logics.Automata play a major role in theory of computation, compiler construction, artificial intelligence, parsing and formal verification.</p>
